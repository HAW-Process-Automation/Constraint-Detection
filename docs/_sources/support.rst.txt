If you encounter an error while running the add-on or you need help with a special use case, click on 'Support'. You will automatically be redirected to the `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/HAW-Process-Automation/Constraint-Detection/issues>`_ of the Constraint Detection Add-on and can open a new issue there. 
Support requests are handled by the Department of Automation of the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences in Germany. For general questions about the use of the add-on, you can click on 'Documentation'. This will redirect you to this 
documentation. In other parts of the UI, there are question mark icons which will open a dialog window where you will find short explanations about certain add-on functions. The 'Select Asset Tree' Section provides a link to the user guide.
