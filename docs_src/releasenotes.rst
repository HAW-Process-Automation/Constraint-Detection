Release Notes
=============

v0.0.3
------

Initial open-source version of **seeq-constraintdetection**

This version of **seeq-constraintdetection** can only be used in Seeq Workbench if you are the workbook owner. If multiple people are working in a shared workbook, only the workbook owner is able to execute the add-on. This is due to a 
bug in SPy that is currently being worked on by Seeq. It is recommended to use SPy from :code:`seeq>=184`.
